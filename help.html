<b>Searching and Sorting</b>
<p>The Project Search page is the first page of the application. To begin a new 
  search from the Search Results page, click on &quot;Menu&quot; and &quot;New 
  Search&quot;. There are nine fields on which you can search. To find a project 
  or list of projects, fill in the criteria in any combination you like. By default, 
  the only two fields that are preselected are &quot;Status,&quot; which is automatically 
  set to &quot;Active,&quot; and &quot;Advisor,&quot; which is automatically set 
  to the Advisor who is currently logged in. Therefore, if you are logged in, 
  then all you need do to retrieve a list of your active projects is click on 
  &quot;Submit&quot;. </p>
<p>With the exception of the &quot;Description&quot; field, which is described 
  below, all of the fields will narrow your search whenever something other than 
  &quot;All&quot; is selected. Therefore the more criteria you enter, the less 
  projects will be retrieved. The &quot;Description&quot; field is a little different. 
  If you select a location AND type something in the &quot;Description&quot; field, 
  the system will find all projects that are either in the selected location OR 
  have a description containing the text you entered into the &quot;Description&quot; 
  field. In this case &quot;Description&quot; will broaden your search. However, 
  if you enter text into the &quot;Description&quot; field and don't select a 
  location, the system will only find projects that have a description containing 
  the text you searched for. In this case &quot;Description&quot; will narrow 
  your search. (Note: there is no need to include "wild-card" characters when 
  searching with the Description field.) </p>
<p>To sort the search results simply click on the column heading of the field 
  you want them sorted by. The system sorts the fields at two levels: first by 
  the field just clicked on, and then by the previously sorted field. Therefore, as 
  an example, if you want the projects sorted by Project Type and then Location, 
  click on the Location column heading first and then click on Project Type.</p>

<b>Viewing, Editing and Saving Projects</b></p>
<p>To view or edit a project, click on the &quot;Details&quot; button of that 
  project on the Search Results page. If you are not logged in, you will be unable 
  to save any changes that are made to this project. On the project page there 
  are two types of data entry: some data is entered directly into textboxes, checkboxes 
  and drop-down lists (i.e. Location and Description), while other data requires 
  you to click on a button which will take you to a new page (i.e. Status Updates 
  and Appraisals). When you make changes to the first kind of data (textboxes 
  etc.) you must click &quot;Save&quot; to permanently save the changes and return to the
  search results, or click on &quot;Cancel&quot; to undo the changes and return to 
  the Search Results page. When you add, edit or delete data of the second kind 
  (i.e. status updates) these changes are automatically saved and clicking &quot;Cancel&quot; 
  will not undo them.  However, if you edit data of the first kind and then add, edit or
  delete data of the second kind, clicking &quot;Cancel&quot; will still undo the first changes.</p>

<p><br>
  <b>Multi-Project Reports</b></p>
<p>To create any of the multi-project reports, first use the Project Search (as 
  described above) to retrieve the list of projects that you want to appear in 
  the report and then follow the instructions below. Once you have created a report 
  you can print it by clicking &quot;File&quot; and &quot;Print&#133;&quot; on 
  your browser. Please ensure that the page settings for these reports are set 
  properly (Landscape orientation and Legal size, see &quot;Printing&quot; below 
  for details). When you have printed your report, use the Back button on your 
  web browser to return to the Search Results page.</p>
<blockquote> 
<p><b>SCH Report</b><br>
  From the search results page, click on &quot;Print&quot; and then &quot;SCH 
  Report.&quot; This takes you to the Create SCH Report page. Here you can fill 
  in the &quot;SSA Amount&quot; and &quot;YTD Expenditures&quot; fields which 
  will appear at the top of the report. These fields are displayed &quot;as is&quot;, 
  so, unlike data entry in the Project pages, you must type in the &quot;$&quot; 
  and decimal places if you want them displayed. Next choose the field you want 
  the projects sorted by. </p>
<p>The subtitle of the SCH Report is automatically created based on the criteria 
  you entered in the Project Search for &quot;Project Type&quot; (i.e. if you 
  searched for &quot;Acquisition&quot; projects, the subtitle will automatically 
  read &quot;Acquisition Report&quot;).</p>
<p><b>General Report</b><br>
  From the search results page, click on &quot;Print&quot; and then &quot;General 
  Report.&quot; This takes you to the Create General Report page. First, indicate 
  whether or not you want to include the SSA Amount and Expenditures to Date information. 
  If you choose to include this information, two columns will be added to the 
  report, as well as two totals which will appear at the top of the report. These 
  totals must be provided by filling in the &quot;SSA Amount&quot; and &quot;YTD 
  Expenditures&quot; fields that are next on the Create General Report page. These 
  fields are displayed &quot;as is&quot; on the report, so, unlike data entry 
  in the Project pages, you must type in the &quot;$&quot; and decimal places 
  if you want them displayed. Next, choose the field you want the projects sorted 
  by. </p>
<p>The subtitle of the General Report is automatically created based on the criteria 
  you entered in the Project Search for &quot;Project Type&quot; (i.e. if you 
  searched for &quot;Acquisition&quot; projects, the subtitle will automatically 
  read &quot;Acquisition Report&quot;).</p>
<p><b>Project Summary Report</b><br>
  This report is the easiest to create. Simply retrieve the projects you want 
  in the report using the Project Search (as described above) and then sort them 
  by clicking on the column headings on the Search Results page (also described 
  above). Then click on &quot;Print&quot; and &quot;Project Summary&quot; to create 
  the report. The projects will appear in the same order as on the Search Results 
  page.</p>

<a name="summary"></a>
<p><br>
  <b>Acquisition and Disposal Summary Reports</b></p>
<p>To print a summary report for a project, open that project by selecting it 
  from the Search Results page and click on &quot;Print&quot; and then &quot;Acquisition 
  Summary&quot; or &quot;Disposal Summary&quot;. This will take you to a page 
  with textboxes for all of the fields on the report. Many of the fields on the 
  Acquisition and Disposal Summary Reports are already in the database but some 
  are not. The first time you go to print one of these reports for a project, 
  as many of these textboxes as possible will be filled in automatically from 
  the actual project data, however, data entered in these textboxes will have 
  no affect on the actual project data. As soon as you click on the &quot;Print 
  Preview&quot; button for the first time, the data in these textboxes will be 
  saved as a separate record and further changes made to the project data will 
  not affect them. The report will display the data from the textboxes &quot;as 
  is&quot;. </p>

<a name="printing"></a>
<p><br>
  <b>Printing and Saving</b></p> 
<p>Some reports require the user to change the printer settings in order to be 
  printed properly. For the following reports, the orientation should be set to 
  &quot;Landscape&quot; and the page size should be set to &quot;Legal&quot;:</p>
<blockquote> 
  SCH Report<br>
  General Report<br>
  Project Summary Report
</blockquote> 
<p>All other reports and printouts should have the orientation set to &quot;Portrait&quot; 
  and the page size set to &quot;Letter&quot;. </p>
<p>To change the settings, open the report you want to print and click &quot;Print&#133;&quot; 
  under the &quot;File&quot; menu of the web browser. Then click on &quot;Properties&quot; 
  in the Print dialog box. This will open the &quot;Properties&quot; dialog box 
  which will vary depending on the printer. There should be Orientation and Paper 
  Size settings somewhere in the dialog box. Choose the appropriate settings. 
  When the changes have been made, click &quot;OK&quot; to close the Properties 
  dialog box and then click &quot;OK&quot; on the Print dialog box to print the 
  report. The changes will only be in effect while the web browser remains open. 
  After it is closed the settings will return to their default values.</p>
<p>You may also want to change the page settings to remove unwanted header and 
  footer information. By default, both Internet Explorer and Netscape print the 
  URL, date, page title, and page numbers on all pages. To remove these follow 
  the instructions for your browser:</p>
<p>Internet Explorer</p>
<blockquote> 
  Click &quot;Page Setup&#133;&quot; under the file menu and remove all of the 
  values entered in the Header and Footer text boxes.
</blockquote> 

<p>Netscape</p>
<blockquote> 
  <p>Click &quot;Page Setup&#133;&quot; under the file menu and uncheck all of 
    the boxes in the Header and Footer sections. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Rather than printing a report, you may want to save it as an html file and 
  e-mail it to someone. To save a report in Internet Explorer you can click on 
  the "Save" link at the top of the report, or click "File -> Save As...". To 
  save a report in Netscape click "File -> Save As...". When you are saving be 
  sure to save the file with "<b>.htm</b>" or "<b>.html</b>" at the end of the 
  name and NOT ".cfm". Please note that when an html file is saved the images 
  on the page are not saved with it, so they will not be printed either. For this 
  reason, printing from a saved copy of Summary of Property Acquisition or Summary 
  of Property Disposal is not recommended.</p>
<p><a class="norm" href="help.html#top">Back to Top</a></p>
<a name="admin"></a>
<p>
  <br><b>Admin Tool</b></p>
<p>If you are logged in an &quot;Admin&quot; button will appear at the top of 
  every page. This is where Locations, Departments, and Client Contacts can be 
  added (these items can also be added when creating a new project). Simply click 
  on &quot;Admin&quot; and then on the category of your choice. A list of all 
  the items will be displayed with the option of editing or deleting each one. 
  There is also a link to add new items just above the list. Both Departments 
  and Locations have an &quot;Active&quot; field. The only difference between 
  an active item and an inactive item is that the inactive item will not be available 
  when creating a new project. This feature would be used if, for example, DFO-SCH 
  and FRPA combined to become DFO-Ports and Harbours. Both DFO-SCH and FRPA would 
  be set to inactive and a new department would be added. This would allow completed 
  projects to retain their original data but would prevent new projects from using 
  either of the two old departments. Active projects could be switched over to 
  the new department on a project-by-project basis.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that if you edit an existing item, this will affect all projects, 
  new and old, that have that item as part of their data. For example, if &quot;Nanaimo&quot; 
  is changed to &quot;Nanaimo (Airport)&quot;, this will affect all projects that 
  have Nanaimo as their location.<br>
